## ⚙️ Installation & Local Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/GuardianRoute.git](https://github.com/your-username/GuardianRoute.git)
cd GuardianRoute

```

### Step 2: Setup the Backend

Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
npm install

```

Start the backend server.

```bash
node server.js
# OR if you use nodemon
nodemon server.js

```

*You should see a message like: `Server running on port 3000*`

### Step 3: Run the Frontend

Since this is a static frontend connecting to a local backend, you can simply open the HTML files.

1. Open the `frontend` folder.
2. Open **`index.html`** in your browser to view the Landing Page.
3. Open **`admin-panel.html`** to access the Admin Dashboard.
4. Open **`driver.html`** to simulate the Driver App.

> **Tip:** For the best experience (especially for Geolocation features), use the **"Live Server"** extension in VS Code to serve the frontend files.

## 📱 How to Test

1. **Open Admin Panel:** Keep `admin-panel.html` open in one tab. You will see the map.
2. **Open Driver App:** Open `driver.html` in a separate tab (or on your phone connected to the same network).
3. **Start Trip:** Click "Start Trip" on the Driver App. Allow Location Permissions.
4. **View Results:** You should see the bus marker moving in real-time on the Admin Dashboard map!
